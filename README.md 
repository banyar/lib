Initialize the project for git:
git init
Add the files to git:
Note that you need to include the period at the end of this command:
git add .
Commit the files
git commit -m "init commit"
Create the repo
Go to your git cloud provider (like github) and create a new repo
Follow the instructions of your provider for creating the new repo
Example

Here is an example of how I created a repo for my package using github:

Browse to: https://github.com/new
Repository name: lib
Leave Public checked
Click: Create repository
Next github prints out some instructions.

I followed the â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line instructions.

Those instruction will be adjusted for your username:
git remote add origin https://github.com/banyar/lib.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


Tag the repo
To publish different versions of your package you need to tag it like this:

git tag v0.1.0 HEAD -m "Version v0.1.0 released"
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin --tags
